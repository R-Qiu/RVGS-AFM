# RVGS-AFM
RVGS-AFM is a short program written for use by the Roanoke Valley Governor's School's (that's the "RVGS") atomic force microscope (and there's the "AFM"). It takes reads the raw data files outputted from RVGS's AFM and produces ISO 4287:1997 consistent measures of surface roughness. 

# Files Needed
.wsf files are needed as data inputs. 

# To Run
Use Python 2.7 with SciPy installed (or NumPy, matplotlib, and Tkinter) to run Main.py

# Acknowledgements
This project would have never been possible without the support of Mr. Mark Levy, director of RVGS, and Mrs. Melissa Fisher, RVGS mathematics teacher.
